# Case Study: Multimodal LLM Tool for Generating Testing Instructions

## Overview

This project showcases a tool designed to generate detailed testing instructions for digital products based on screenshots. By leveraging a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), this tool can interpret visual content and provide relevant testing instructions to ensure product quality.

## Features

- **Multimodal Processing**: Utilizes advanced LLM to interpret screenshots and generate contextual instructions.
- **File Handling**: Supports uploading multiple screenshots for comprehensive analysis.
- **Dynamic Context**: Allows optional contextual input to refine the generated instructions.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Provides immediate feedback and instructions based on the uploaded screenshots.

## Architecture

1. **Frontend**: Built using React to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading screenshots and inputting context.
2. **Backend**: Node.js server handling file uploads and interaction with the multimodal LLM.

### Frontend

- **Components**:
  - **File Upload**: Allows users to upload multiple screenshots.
  - **Context Input**: Optional field for providing additional context.
  - **Instruction Display**: Shows generated instructions.

- **Technology**:
  - React
  - Axios for API calls
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend

- **Components**:
  - **File Handling**: Manages file uploads using Multer.
  - **Python Script Execution**: Runs a Python script to get descriptions from screenshots.
  - **LLM Integration**: Connects to a multimodal LLM to generate instructions based on descriptions.

- **Technology**:
  - Node.js
  - Multer for file uploads
  - Python for image processing
  - Multimodal LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT, BLIP)

## Setup
